# About me 🪼
I'm an Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, Canada currently interning at Untether AI. 

I'm learning more about React and JavaScript to create a new (and prettier) personal portfolio.
I'm also hoping to learn more about computer vision and start working on some hardware projects!!
